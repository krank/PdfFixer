## PDF Fixer

The plan is for this to evolve into a simple commandline tool for manipulating PDF files. Currently it's just some experiments.

### Functionality
* Read configuration from json
* Insert blank pages
* Removing specific pages
* Removing PDF layers including contents
* Edit metadata (Title, Author, Description & Keywords), both XMP & classic
* Modifying layer label names

### Planned functionality
* Insert pages from other PDFs
* Maybe: Dryruns & reports
* Maybe: Extract pages to new PDF
